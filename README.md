# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website!

## Introduction

This website serves as a showcase of my professional skills, projects, and experiences. It's designed to represent my journey as a developer and as a canvas for my personal brand.

## Built With

My portfolio is a labor of love, built with:

- **React.js** - For a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - For a sleek, modern look with well-designed components.
- **Framer Motion** - To add smooth and engaging animations, making the UX more interactive.
